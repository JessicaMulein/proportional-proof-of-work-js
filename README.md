# proportional-proof-of-work-js
JavaScript portion of the proportional proof of work PHP code

This package itself doesn't provide the proportional aspect of the title, but this is intended to work in conjunction with the laravel package which adjusts the computational intensity in relation to session activity (work-based throttling).

This is in the early alpha stages, though the core proof of work functionality seems correct and compatible between PHP and JavaScript.
